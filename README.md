This is a simple python program to verify whether a person was invited to a party or not.

This program acts as a guest list checker for a party, allowing users to enter a name and see if they’re invited.
How It Works:
- The program starts with a predefined list of invited guests: David, Charles, Walter, Steve, Anonymous, and Kido.
- Users enter a name to check if they’re on the list.
- It runs continuously until the user types exit.
Commands You Can Use:
- Enter a name → Checks if the person is invited.
- If the name is found, it prints a welcome message.
- If not, it politely informs the user that they aren’t on the list.
- exit → Stops the program.
Notes:
- The program doesn't differentiate between uppercase and lowercase names (e.g., "DAVID" and "david" are treated the same).
- It only checks single-word names (e.g., “john” works, but “john smith” won’t).
It’s a simple tool to verify guests before they enter a party! Let me know if you need adjustments.
